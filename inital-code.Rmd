When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}

msa = read.csv("F:/mass-shootings-msa.csv")

install.packages("FSelector")
library(FSelector)
```
```{r}

#running the filter based feature selection techniques

victims <- msa$Total.Number.of.Victims

information.gain(victims~msa$State +msa$History.of.Mental.Illness...General+msa$Shooter.Sex...Coded+msa$Average.Shooter.Age+msa$Total.Number.of.Guns+msa$Possible.Motive...General+msa$Military.Experience...Coded+msa$School.Related...Coded,msa)

# This shows that average shooter age and state of shooting have a moderately high correlation with total number of victims per incident.



```

```{r}

# This shows that state of incident, average shooter age, total number of guns, and possible motive have a moderately high correlation with total number of victims per incident. 

```

```{r}

# running the random forest test, which is a wrapper-based feature selection technique
